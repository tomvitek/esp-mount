# EspMount
This project's goal is to create a controller for modified SkyWatcher EQ6 mount (although theoretically, any mount with two stepper motors will do).

## Project goals
- simple communication protocol
- easy to deploy
- allow for fast slew speeds and precise tracking (for satellites)

## Status
Project is currently in heavy development and isn't ready yet. Therefore, all the source files are currently only in `devel` branch and will be 
pushed into `main` once the first version is complete
